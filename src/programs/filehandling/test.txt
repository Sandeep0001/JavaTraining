Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a sequence of specific activities conducted during the testing process to
ensure software quality goals are met.
STLC involves both verification and validation activities.
Contrary to popular belief, Software Testing is not just a single/isolate activity, i.e. testing.
It consists of a series of activities carried out methodologically to help certify your software product.
STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle.
